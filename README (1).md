# Real Time Stock Price Dashboard

This was originally made for my grandmother who loves investing :)

This project is a real-time full-stack stock price dashboard built using Python, Streamlit, Plotly, and various financial data analysis tools. The dashboard allows users to visualize stock prices, apply technical indicators such as SMA 20, EMA20, and RSI14, and monitor real-time prices of selected stocks.

*Enjoy a stock price dashboard that you can run right in your terminal*!

## Usage
### Interface Overview

* **Ticker** - Enter the stock ticker symbol you want to analyze (e.g., AAPL for Apple Inc.)

* **Time Period** - Select the time period over which you want to view the stock data (e.g., 1d, 1wk, 1mo, 1y, etc.)

* **Chart Type** - Choose between a candlestick chart and a line chart

* **Technical Indicators** - Select one or more technical indicators to apply to the chart

### Real-Time Stock Prices

The sidebar displays the real-time prices for a predefined list of stock symbols (e.g., AAPL, GOOGL, AMZN, MSFT). These prices update automatically and show the percentage change from the opening price.

### Customization

You can easily modify the list of stock symbols monitored in real-time by editing the stock_symbols list in the app.py file.

### Example Usage

1. Monitoring Apple Stock in Real-Time:

    * Enter `AAPL` in the ticker input

    * Select `1d` for the time period

    * Choose the Candlestick chart type

    * Select `SMA 20`, `EMA 20`, & `RSI 14` for technical indicators

    * Click `Update` to visualize the data

2. Viewing Historical Data:

    * Select a longer time period (e.g., `1y`)

    * Use the `Line` chart type for a smooth trend visualization.

    * Analyze the historical data displayed below the chart.

## Known Issues

  * **Data Fetching Errors**: If no data is returned for a given ticker, an error message will be displayed. Ensure that the ticker symbol is correct and try again.
